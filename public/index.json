One key prevention strategy is to follow antimicrobial stewardship practices, in particular, to maximise targeted oral therapy and reduce the use of indwelling vascular devices for intravenous (IV)administration. Appreciating when an individual patient can switch from IV to oral antibiotic treatment is often non-trivial and not standardised. To tackle this problem we created a machine learning model to predict when a patient could switch based on routinely collected clinical parameters. 10,362 unique intensive care unit stays were extracted and two informative feature sets identified. Our best model achieved a mean AUROC of 0.80 (SD 0.01) on the hold-out set while not being biased to individuals protected characteristics. Interpretability methodologies were employed to create clinically useful visual explanations. In summary, our model provides individualised, fair, and interpretable predictions for when a patient could switch from IV-to-oral antibiotic treatment. Prospectively evaluation of safety and efficacy is needed before such technology can be applied clinically.","tags":["AI","Machine Learning","Antibiotic Optimisation","Clinical Decision Support","Interpretability","Ethics"],"title":"Personalising intravenous to oral antibiotic switch decision making through fair interpretable machine learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1702512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702512000,"objectID":"88f784ba185980f5bfef9b6916082d06","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talk/ethical-and-responsible-ai/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ethical-and-responsible-ai/","section":"event","summary":"Talk on ethical and responsible AI for CAMO-Net, a Wellcome funded, multidisciplinary, global collaboration working together to address the impact of antimicrobial resistance on human health","tags":["Ethics","Responsible AI"],"title":"Ethical and Responsible AI","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

In 2019, bacterial AMR was found to be associated with approximately 4.95 million of deaths across 204 countries with 1.2 million of them directly attributed to it. Misuse and overuse of antibiotics are significant drivers in the development of AMR. To deal with AMR, a multi-modal approach is needed including antimicrobial stewardship to preserve the ef- fectiveness of currently available agents. Recent research has focused on using electronic health records (EHRs) for infection diagnoses and antibiotic therapy selection through machine learning (ML), but little work has focused on antimicrobial stewardship. Inade- quate, ineffective or incomplete antibiotic treatment often leads to antibiotic retreatment (antibiotic readmission), causing unnecessary and excessive use of antibiotics.\nThis project applied electronic health records of 2,189 intensive care unit (ICU) patients from the MIMIC-IV database to develop ML-based decision support models using deep learning approach to reliably predict whether ICU patients will be retreated with antibiotic if current antibiotic treatment is discontinued. This project is formulated and addressed as both classification and regression tasks. Accurately predicting antibiotic readmission (antibiotic retreatment) for ICU patients could be extremely helpful in optimising antibiotic treatment to combat AMR by providing individualised predictions to support the decision on continuation or cessation of antibiotic treatment.\n","date":1687305600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687305600,"objectID":"a06d5d1a70ee261d75bc337954e54818","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/readmission/","publishdate":"2023-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/readmission/","section":"project","summary":"Supervised masters student project","tags":["AI","Deep Learning","Clinical Decision Support"],"title":"Deep Learning for Individualised Antibiotic Readmission Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":["William Bolton","Vasileios Stylianos Sotiropoulos","Pantelis Georgiou"],"categories":null,"content":"In this study, we present a machine learning-based clinical decision support system for the individualised prediction of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) following a Vancomycin with Piperacillin-Tazobactam (VPT) ad- ministration. AKI can be a critical side effect associated with the use of antibiotics, particularly in severely ill patients. Consequently, from a clinical perspective, being able to accurately predict the risk of AKI on an individual patient basis can contribute significantly to the decision making process by supporting decisions such as initiation and cessation of treatment as well as frequency of monitoring.\nOur work uses a series of machine learning algorithms based on the electronic health records (EHR) of all the patients who were administered VPT in order to develop a predictive model for AKI. Taking into account that their corresponding explicit diagnoses stored are lacking timestamps and therefore cannot be evaluated in terms of reliability, it includes the development of an implicit label generation algorithm that can be used to produce accurate and detailed diagnostic information based on KDIGO AKI guidelines.\nAfter applying a wide range of filters and experimenting with several data configurations, a comprehensive dataset was formed by incorporating patient demographics, medical history, and laboratory values and was used to train and evaluate our selection of algorithms. The final results obtained with our best performing model indicated a high level of effectiveness for our binary classifier in predicting the occurrence of AKI following a VPT administration. Specifically, an AUC estimation of ≈ 0.83 was achieved using a trained logistic regression model and 10-fold cross validation. This demonstrates a balanced trade off between sen- sitivity and specificity and showcases the model’s strong ability in distinguishing between the two classes.\nIn order to ascertain the validity of our results, a second EHR database was utilised. This indicated a consistency in the performance attained and consequently verified the generalisability of our model. As a result, we can conclude that the use of our suggested model could provide credible information to clinicians regarding potential side effects from antibiotic prescribing, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimise their use.\n","date":1687305600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687305600,"objectID":"5b38f48501ad00bf8595187934502e83","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/side_effect/","publishdate":"2023-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/side_effect/","section":"project","summary":"Supervised masters student project","tags":["AI","Machine Learning","Clinical Decision Support"],"title":"Machine learning based clinical decision support for individualised antibiotic side effect prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1681556400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681556400,"objectID":"6372eec70386cb1ebe0ab0f60a1c1ea9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talk/digital-solutions-for-infectious-disease-session-at-eccmid-2023/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/digital-solutions-for-infectious-disease-session-at-eccmid-2023/","section":"event","summary":"Presented my PhD research to \u003e250 people at ECCMID 2023 a leading global conference on infectious disease","tags":["AI","Deep Learning","Antibiotic Optimisation","Clinical Decision Support"],"title":"Digital Solutions for Infectious Disease Session at ECCMID 2023","type":"event"},{"authors":["William Bolton","Cosmin Badea","Pantelis Georgiou","Alison Holmes","Timothy Rawson"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667260800,"objectID":"3bd0b76958aac2c791d0470fce1885ea","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/ethics/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ethics/","section":"publication","summary":"The use of decision-support systems based on artificial intelligence approaches in antimicrobial prescribing raises important moral questions.

Ceasing too early can drive treatment failure, while excessive treatment risks adverse events. Under- and over-treatment can promote the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We extracted routinely collected electronic health record data from the MIMIC-IV database for 18,988 patients (22,845 unique stays) who received intravenous antibiotic treatment during an intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A model was developed that utilises a recurrent neural network autoencoder and a synthetic control-based approach to estimate patients’ ICU length of stay (LOS) and mortality outcomes for any given day, under the alternative scenarios of if they were to stop vs. continue antibiotic treatment. Control days where our model should reproduce labels demonstrated minimal difference for both stopping and continuing scenarios indicating estimations are reliable (LOS results of 0.24 and 0.42 days mean delta, 1.93 and 3.76 root mean squared error, respectively). Meanwhile, impact days where we assess the potential effect of the unobserved scenario showed that stopping antibiotic therapy earlier had a statistically significant shorter LOS (mean reduction 2.71 days, p-value \u003c0.01). No impact on mortality was observed. In summary, we have developed a model to reliably estimate patient outcomes under the contrasting scenarios of stopping or continuing antibiotic treatment. Retrospective results are in line with previous clinical studies that demonstrate shorter antibiotic treatment durations are often non-inferior. With additional development into a clinical decision support system, this could be used to support individualised antimicrobial cessation decision-making, reduce the excessive use of antibiotics, and address the problem of AMR.","tags":["AI","Deep Learning","Antibiotic Optimisation","Clinical Decision Support"],"title":"Machine learning and synthetic outcome estimation for individualised antimicrobial cessation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Holly worrall","Anjana Nair","Charlie Delikan","Damien Ming","William Bolton","Bernard Hernandez"],"categories":null,"content":"The aim of the project was to create a small, accessible booklet in a zine format illustrating the key ideas behind the use of data, AI, and decision-support with a focus on healthcare applications.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
