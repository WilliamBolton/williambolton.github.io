The LLM-powered pipeline takes as input a set of medically focused prompts it then undertakes research into the topics of interest, extracts useful information, generates a video script, identifies relevant media and determines the most appropriate way to present specific pieces of information. This content is then fed into the API of an AI avatar generation company (e.g., Synthesia) and subsequently combined to generate the patient information video. You can view samples of the videos at the 'Video' link above.
