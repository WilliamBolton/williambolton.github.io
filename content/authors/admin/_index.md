Hi, my name is Will! 

I am interested in all things artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare, and recently completed my PhD at Imperial College London. My PhD focused on researching AI-driven clinical decision support for antibiotic optimisation and resulted in the development of a web app that is currently being clinically evaluated. To date, I have published 5 first-authored publications in leading medical journals and AI conference workshops, including Nature Communications, AAAI and ICLR. During my PhD, I conducted an internship at GSK.ai on the reliability of LLM’s in the biomedical domain, and previously completed my Master’s in Bioscience Enterprise at the University of Cambridge. 

I care about impact and am highly interested in entrepreneurship and how startups with new innovative technology can create solutions to real-world problems. I am currently working on several projects and exploring opportunities post my PhD.

In my spare time, I like all things sports including rugby, running, climbing and F1. 

Feel free to get in contact!
